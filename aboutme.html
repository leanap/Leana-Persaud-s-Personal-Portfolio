  <p>I'm currently a Senior in the Web & App Development CTE Course at Thomas A. Edison Career and Technical High School. I've always had a passion for creating, whether it was through painting or creating websites. I've learned about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python throughout my high school years. Even though I plan to pursue a career in Architecture, Interior Design or Accounting, Web & App Development will always be something I enjoy and I look forward to developing more websites in the future.</p>
